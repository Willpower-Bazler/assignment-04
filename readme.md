Simply put, a browser is used to retrieve information from the world wide web, and show it on your specific device. The only browser I use is Chrome. I wasn't a fan of Edge.

A markup language is for processing, defining, and presenting a text. For example, you might write "<title>my first page</title>", but the only part that will show up when others view it is "my first page".
